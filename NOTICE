Redpack for Ruby/Node/Java is developed by Lux Delux Inc by modifying 
MessagePack-RPC for the purposes of running on top of Redis queues.  
Currently there are modifications that are not completely backwards 
compatible with the original MsgPack-RPC spec so we are making this a 
separate project under the same license.
